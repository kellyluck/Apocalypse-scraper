# Apocalypse scraper

Basically it scrapes the Wikipedia page on apocalyptic events & dumps them to a JSON file. A little helper project for a thing I'm working on.

Uses HTML Agility Pack (https://html-agility-pack.net/download) to do the parsifyin'. Feel free to snag this code for whatever wiki-scrapey project you may be working on.
